<p>OVERVIEW:</p>
<p>Jump Puzzle -
The idea was to create a 1st person 3D platforming puzzle with a "floor is lava" concept. If the player falls, the level is reset. The player must traverse obstacles, mostly involving jumping from platform to platform</p>

<ul>
	CONTROLS:
  <li>Left-click: move forward</li>
  <li>Right-click: move backwards</li>
  <li>Hold shift (while clicking): sprint</li>
  <li>Space bar: jump</li>
  <li>A, D keys: step left and step right</li>
  <li>r: reset at starting position</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	LAYOUT:
  <li> The final scene is "lava_scene", all other scenes were used to implement concepts before adding them to the final scene</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	ASSETS:
  <li>A few materials and shaders were used from the Ultimate VFX pack
		<a href="https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/26701">https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/26701</a>
		(Alex had a paid copy of this package from a previous internship).
		Everything from this pack is in the "Mirza Beig" folder.</li>
  <li>Many of the materials in the Resources folder were made by group members,
	but the rock textures were free from <a href="https://shop.bitgem3d.com/">https://shop.bitgem3d.com/</a></li>
  <li> </li>
</ul>

<ul>
TECHNIQUES USED:
  <li>Basic physics: mass, gravity using Unity's engine</li>
  <li>Various lighting techniques</li>
  <li>shallow_wave from lab 5 was used to act as a lava floor</li>
  <li>Collisions</li>
  <li>Tranformation, rotation (of platforms and player character)</li>
  <li>Particle Systems (portals)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
DIVISION OF THE WORK:
  <li>All team members worked on level design.</li>
  <li>Ian: Lighting, scripts, texturing, rotating platform script</li>
  <li>Thomas: Portal functionality, moving platform, scripts, texturing, teleporting, moving platform script</li>
  <li>Alex: portal particle system, texturing of rock platforms, scripts, death_on_impact</li>
</ul>
